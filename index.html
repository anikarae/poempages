<h1 style="color:#FCFCFC; text-align: center;">Dreamland</h1>
<h2 style="text-align: center; color:#FCFCFC; ">By Lewis Carroll</h2>
<p style="color: #FCFCFC; text-align: center;">When midnight mists are creeping,</br>
And all the land is sleeping,</br>
Around me tread the mighty dead,</br>
And slowly pass away.</br>
Lo, warriors, saints, and sages,</br>
From out the vanished ages,</br>
With solemn pace and reverend face</br>
Appear and pass away.</br>
The blaze of noonday splendour,</br>
The twilight soft and tender,</br>
May charm the eye: yet they shall die,</br>
Shall die and pass away.</br>
But here, in Dreamland's centre,</br>
No spoiler's hand may enter,</br>
These visions fair, this radiance rare,</br>
Shall never pass away.</br>
I see the shadows falling,</br>
The forms of old recalling;</br>
Around me tread the mighty dead,</br>
And slowly pass away.</br></p>
